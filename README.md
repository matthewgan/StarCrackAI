StarCraft is a real-time strategy(RTS) game that combines fast-paced micro-actions with the need for high-level planning and execution. Over the previous two decades, StarCraft I and II have been pioneering and enduring e-sports, with millions of casual and highly competitive professional players. In Aug 2017, Deepmind published a paper "StarCraftII: A New Challenge for Reinforcement Learning" giving some intuitions about how to train AI to defeat top human players. Right now AI player is good at single-agent, single-player interacting, but poor performance on multi-agent, with multiple-players interacting. We are trying to build a system supervised learning from replays and reinforcement learning from baseline agents, mimic human player actions and ... You can solo or 2v1 against AI, would be a lot of fun!
